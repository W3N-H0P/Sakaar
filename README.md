The Grand Master welcomes you! Please enjoy your stay!

Well, I tried to start a revolution, but didn’t print enough pamphlets. So hardly anyone turned up, except for my mum and her boyfriend, who I hate. As punishment, I was forced to be in here and become a gladiator. Bit of a promotional disaster, that one. But I’m actually organizing another revolution. I don’t know if you’d be interested in something like that. Do you reckon you’d be interested?

Fear is the mind killer.
